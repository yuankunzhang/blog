Today I want to have a clean OS reinstallation on my development machine. The primary reason is that the root partition is almost full (due to short-sightness when I first set up this machine). Apart from that, there are several other issues that I want to tackle:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I got a lot of &lt;code>__common_interrupt: 1.55 No irq handler for vector&lt;/code> errors during the system bootup. There&amp;rsquo;s a thread in the Arch Forum discussing this issue. I tried booting up the system with different kernel parameters, but none helped. Seems like the only solution is to upgrade the BIOS firmware.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I cannot use my bluetooth keyboard to input decryption key to decrypt the root partition, because the bluetooth service is locked in the root partition and it&amp;rsquo;s a chicken-egg problem. This is quite disturbing, everytime I restarted the machine, I had to wire in my USB keyboard just to input the decryption key.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
