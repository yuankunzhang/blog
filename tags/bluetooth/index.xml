Today I decided to have a clean OS reinstallation on my development machine due to several reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Firstly, the root partition on this machine is nearing full capacity (thank you, my past self).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secondly, I&amp;rsquo;m consistently encountering &lt;code>__common_interrupt: 1.55 No irq handler for vector&lt;/code> errors during system bootup. There&amp;rsquo;s a thread in the Arch Forum discussing this issue. Despite my efforts to resolve it through various ombinations of kernel parameters as suggested in the thread, I have not succeeded. It appears that the only viable solution is a BIOS firmware upgrade.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, there exists a paradoxical issue: I cannot decrypt the root partition without using my bluetooth keyboard, yet I cannot use my bluetooth keyboard until the root partition is decrypted and mounted (because the bluetooth driver sits in the root partition). This presents a typical chicken and egg problem. My current hack around is to use a wired USB keyboard to decrypt the root parition. However, I desperately want to abandon this workaround.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
