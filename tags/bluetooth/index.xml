      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://yuankun.me/posts/home-server-setup&#34;&gt;home server build&lt;/a&gt;. Today I want to have a clean OS reinstallation on my development machine. The primary reason is that the root partition is almost full (due to short-sightness when I first set up this machine). Apart from that, there are several other issues that I want to tackle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a lot of &lt;code&gt;__common_interrupt: 1.55 No irq handler for vector&lt;/code&gt; errors during the system bootup. There&amp;rsquo;s a thread in the Arch Forum discussing this issue. I tried booting up the system with different kernel parameters, but none helped. Seems like the only solution is to upgrade the BIOS firmware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot use my bluetooth keyboard to input decryption key to decrypt the root partition, because the bluetooth service is locked in the root partition and it&amp;rsquo;s a chicken-egg problem. This is quite disturbing, everytime I restarted the machine, I had to wire in my USB keyboard just to input the decryption key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
