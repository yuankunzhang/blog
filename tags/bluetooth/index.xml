Today I decided to have a clean OS reinstallation on my development machine due to several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the root partition on this machine is nearing full capacity (thank you, my past self).</li>
<li>Secondly, I&rsquo;m consistently encountering <code>__common_interrupt: 1.55 No irq handler for vector</code> errors during system bootup. There&rsquo;s a thread in the Arch Forum discussing this issue. Despite my efforts to resolve it through various ombinations of kernel parameters as suggested in the thread, I have not succeeded. It appears that the only viable solution is a BIOS firmware upgrade.</li>
<li>Finally, there exists a paradoxical issue: I cannot decrypt the root partition without using my bluetooth keyboard, yet I cannot use my bluetooth keyboard until the root partition is decrypted and mounted (because the bluetooth driver sits in the root partition). This presents a typical chicken and egg problem. My current hack around is to use a wired USB keyboard to decrypt the root parition. However, I desperately want to abandon this workaround.</li>
</ul>
