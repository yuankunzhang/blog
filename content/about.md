YUANKUN ZHANG                 Linux User's Manual                 YUANKUN ZHANG(8)

NAME
      Yuankun Zhang - a programmer

SYNOPSIS
      yuankun [--devops] [--opensource] [--linux-user] [--father]

SUMMARY
      Hi there! I'm a passionate programmer, and I code for fun. I am familiar
      with DevOps technologies. I use Arch Linux. In my spare time, I like
      running and playing badminton.

OPTIONS
      --devops
        I have experience in the DevOps practices and am familar with the tools
        and approaches used in this space.

        I prefer statically typed languages (C, Golang, Java) over dynamically
        typed languages (Python, JavaScript), even though in most of my time I
        write Python. I'm learning Rust now, and it seems really interesting.

      --opensource
        I like to contribute to open source projects whenever I have time. Check
        out my Github space in the SEE ALSO section for the projects I have been
        involved in.

      --linux-user
        I use Arch Linux as my primary operating system, and run only open source
        applications. I also have a Ubuntu virtual machine to run work-related,
        proprierty softwares (such as Zoom and Webex).

      --father
        In 2021, I have been propagated from a leaf node to an internal node in my
        family tree. Being a father is no easy work, but it is the most proud role
        I've ever had. I'm ready to learn and grow together with my new leaf node.
