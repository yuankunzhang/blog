      <description>As you may have already known, all the IPs of Google Cloud Platform share the same geolocation, which is the US. This buggy thing has been marked as &amp;ldquo;intended behavior&amp;rdquo;, so no fix would be expected in the future. Even ironically, the guy who raised this issue was &amp;ldquo;kindly advised&amp;rdquo; to contact Google&amp;rsquo;s legal department. Here is the issue ticket.
Dear Google, when people create a network in a chosen region, they expect the public IPs of the network to be in that region.</description>
