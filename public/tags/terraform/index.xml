      <description>There are two types of service accounts in Google Cloud: user-managed service accounts, which are used by user applications to talk to Google Cloud; and Google-managed services accounts, which are used by Google Cloud internally. Among the second category, there is a special subtype of service accounts called Google Cloud Service Agents. Service Agents are used by Google Cloud services to run internal processes so that user requested operations can be fulfilled.</description>
